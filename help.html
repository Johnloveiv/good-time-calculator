    <p>This app helps you determine the likely diminution of sentence ("good time") for offenders 
    sentenced to imprisonment in Louisiana under La. R.S. 15:571.3.  
    To use it, you must know the sentence the offender received along with the amount of time that was 
    credited for time served while awaiting sentencing.  Enter these values with numbers and time units, like 
    "8 years" or "1 year 6 months 5 days". Click on "Calculate Good Time" and the likely number of days the  
    offender will serve before being released on parole will appear at the top of your screen. </p>
    <p>Please note that if the offender was sentenced as a habitual offender under La. R.S. 15:529.1, they will not 
    receive good time</p>
